## Skills & Experience 💡

### Databases 🗄️
- **Matrimonial Bureau Project:**  
  Utilized Oracle to design a relational–object database for a matrimonial bureau. Implemented a bidirectional matchmaking algorithm that matches users based on their traits and preferences. 💘
- **CarRentalDB Project:**  
  Applied T-SQL to design and manage a relational database for a car rental service. This system handles detailed operational processes such as transaction tracking and scheduling. 🚗

### Object-Oriented Programming 💻
- Developed skills in **C++** and **Java** using object-oriented paradigms (classes, inheritance, encapsulation).  
  In the "Warcaby" (Checkers) project in Java, I built the game logic, user interface, and piece movement mechanisms. 🎮

### Scripting & Data Analysis 📊
- Proficient in **Python** and its libraries such as Matplotlib, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.  
  In the "Interdependence of HIV and AIDS in Poland" project, I performed exploratory data analysis to visualize and identify key trends in the epidemiological data. 🔍

### Web Development 🌐
- Created websites using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript,** and **Node.js**.  
  For a student project at Lodz University of Technology, I implemented an interactive campus map with seamless backend-to-frontend integration to enhance academic life organization. 🗺️

### Other Technologies 📱
- Gaining expertise in mobile app development using **Swift**.  
  Designed a prototype in **Figma** for an app promoting the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Siedlce, which won first place in the InterStudent UWS 2024 competition. 🏆

## Data Analysis Projects 📈

### Heart (Statlog) Project ❤️
In this project, I developed a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical data from the Statlog (Heart) dataset. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. I employed algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, and conducted extensive exploratory data analysis with correlation plots, box plots, and heatmaps to identify the most significant factors influencing heart disease prediction.

### HIV/AIDS Epidemiological Analysis in Poland 🌍
This project focused on analyzing HIV/AIDS data in Poland, with special emphasis on regional differences between voivodeships like Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Zachodniopomorskie. Through detailed statistical analysis and visualizations (including radar charts, maps, and trend analysis), I examined the dynamics of HIV/AIDS transmission and progression. The insights from this analysis help tailor targeted public health interventions and deepen our understanding of the epidemic's evolution.
