## Skills & Experience 💡

### Databases 🗄️
- **Matrimonial Bureau Project:**  
  Utilized Oracle to design a relational–object database for a matrimonial bureau. Implemented a bidirectional matchmaking algorithm that matches users based on their traits and preferences. 💘
- **CarRentalDB Project:**  
  Applied T-SQL to design and manage a relational database for a car rental service. This system handles detailed operational processes such as transaction tracking and scheduling. 🚗

### Memory Allocation (malloc project) 💻
- Implemented a custom memory allocator in C as part of an Operating Systems project. The allocator includes custom implementations of `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`, along with utility functions for memory monitoring and defragmentation. The project focuses on efficient heap management and error detection using memory fences. 🔧

### Object-Oriented Programming 💻
- Developed skills in **C++** and **Java** using object-oriented paradigms (classes, inheritance, encapsulation).  

### Scripting & Data Analysis 📊
- Proficient in **Python** and its libraries such as Matplotlib, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.  
  In the "Interdependence of HIV and AIDS in Poland" project, I performed exploratory data analysis to visualize and identify key trends in the epidemiological data. 🔍

### Web Development 🌐
- Created websites using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript,** and **Node.js**.  
  For a student project at Lodz University of Technology, I implemented an interactive campus map with seamless backend-to-frontend integration to enhance academic life organization. 🗺️

### Other Technologies 📱
- Gaining expertise in mobile app development using **Swift**.  
  Designed a prototype in **Figma** for an app promoting the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Siedlce, which won first place in the InterStudent UWS 2024 competition. 🏆

## Data Analysis Projects 📈

### Spiders Project 🕷️
This project analyzes biomedical signals collected from individuals with arachnophobia while they watched spider videos.  
The dataset includes ECG, GSR, and respiratory signals, which were carefully filtered, segmented, and processed.  
Key features were extracted manually using techniques like Pan-Tompkins QRS detection for ECG and peak analysis for GSR and respiration.  
A machine learning model was then trained to classify emotional states based on the extracted features.  
The project served as a hands-on exercise in biomedical signal processing, feature engineering, and classification modeling.

### Heart (Statlog) Project ❤️
In this project, I developed a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical data from the Statlog (Heart) dataset. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. I employed algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, and conducted extensive exploratory data analysis with correlation plots, box plots, and heatmaps to identify the most significant features influencing heart disease prediction.

### HIV/AIDS Epidemiological Analysis in Poland 🌍
This project focused on analyzing HIV/AIDS data in Poland, with a special emphasis on regional differences between voivodeships like Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Zachodniopomorskie. Through detailed statistical analysis and visualizations (including radar charts, maps, and trend analysis), I examined the dynamics of HIV/AIDS transmission and progression. The insights gained from this analysis can help tailor targeted public health interventions and enhance our understanding of the epidemic's evolution.

### Hack na Zdrowie 🏥  
Led a multidisciplinary team during the **Hack na Zdrowie** hackathon organized by **Biuro Karier UMED**. Together, we developed **PillGuards** — a smart pill dispenser for dementia patients combining intelligent hardware with a mobile app.  
I was responsible for **project coordination**, **3D and AR modeling**, and the **application prototype**.  
Our solution received a **special award**: a consultation voucher from **Consonance** for its technological and regulatory potential. 🏆
